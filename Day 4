VIRUTALIZATION: 
	Virtualization addresses these challenges by introducing a layer of abstraction between the hardware and the operating system. It enables the creation of multiple virtual instances, each running its own operating system and applications, on a single physical server.
		
Components of Virtualization: 
Hypervisor (Virtual Machine Monitor):
	The hypervisor is a crucial component of virtualization. It sits between the hardware and the operating systems, managing and allocating resources to virtual machines (VMs).
	There are two types of hypervisors: Type 1 (bare-metal) runs directly on the hardware, while Type 2 (hosted) runs on top of an existing operating system.
Virtual Machines (VMs):
	VMs are the instances created by the hypervisor. Each VM operates as an independent computer with its own virtualized hardware, including CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces.
Multiple VMs can run on a single physical server, allowing for efficient resource utilization.
